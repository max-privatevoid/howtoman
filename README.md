# howtoman

A brief guide on how to read a manpage. I created this because man pages can be hard to read even though they are very useful. Just look at the manpage for `man` itself and you'll see how daunting it can be. I remember myself as a beginner trying to read them and not knowing how to or even where to look for help.

## Usage

```
$ man howtoman
```
